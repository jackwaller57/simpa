# Creating a 737 MAX Interface Placeholder Image

If you don't have access to a Boeing 737 MAX interface image, you can create a simple placeholder:

1. Use an image editing tool like Photoshop, GIMP, or even PowerPoint
2. Create a new image with dimensions 1280x720 pixels
3. Create a gray/blue gradient background (from #5a6373 to #3f4655)
4. Add some interface elements:
   - A header bar with "737 MAX" text
   - Some buttons and panels
   - A central screen area
5. Save as "737max-interface.jpg" in this directory

## Simple Online Option

Alternatively, you can:
1. Visit a free online design tool like Canva or Figma
2. Choose a "Presentation" template (16:9 aspect ratio)
3. Create a slide with a blue-gray gradient background
4. Add rectangles, text, and buttons to simulate an interface
5. Export as JPG and rename to "737max-interface.jpg"

## Easiest Option

The CSS already includes a fallback gradient, so the app will work even without this image, but the UI will look better with a proper aircraft interface background.
